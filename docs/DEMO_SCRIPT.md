## 🎯 Key Talking Points

### If They Ask: "How does it work?"
> "Three AI agents work together:
> 1. Memory Agent - stores everything
> 2. Router - figures out who needs to know
> 3. Critic - catches conflicts and mistakes
> 
> They turn your communication into a living knowledge graph."

### If They Ask: "What makes this different?"
> "Three things:
> 1. **Visual** - See your org, don't just search it
> 2. **Proactive** - It tells YOU what's wrong
> 3. **Versioned** - Every decision has a history, like Git for decisions"

### If They Ask: "What's next?"
> "We're adding:
> - Slack integration
> - Voice commands
> - Automatic meeting capture
> - Mobile app
> 
> But we want to nail the core experience first."
